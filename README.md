# Interactive Data Science Web App with Streamlit 

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that streamlines the creation of web applications for machine learning and data science. Tailored for data scientists and ML engineers, it enables the quick development of interactive, data-driven web interfaces without requiring in-depth web development knowledge. Streamlit integrates well with various data visualization libraries and offers features like real-time updates, interactive widgets, and customization options, making it an excellent choice for showcasing and exploring data insights.

In this notebook, weâ€™ll start with an introduction to Streamlit, covering data loading and visualization, followed by deploying machine learning model. Here are two deployed models on Streamlit for customer churn prediction:

- This app uses a pre-trained model to predict the likelihood of customer churn: [Customer Churn Prediction App](https://customerchrunprediction-59.streamlit.app/)

- This app provides a complete walkthrough for training a machine learning model for customer churn prediction: [End-to-End Churn Model Training App](https://app-train-churnmodeling.streamlit.app/)


Python code and data files needed to run this notebook are available via this [link](https://github.com/MehdiRezvandehy/streamlit).
